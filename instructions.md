# Instructions

This branch of the repository contains a complete and working copy of the app from the `implementing-auth` branch.

In order for the app to function, it requires a `.env` file in the `api/` folder, containing two variables:

```bash
PORT=3000
DB_URL=[valid PostgreSQL connection string]
```
